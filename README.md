__Note (updated May 2024): Autograd is not currently maintained, and the
authors do not plan to respond to future issues or pull requests. Those looking
for a similar user experience (with powerful additional features) can consider
using [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax), a successor to Autograd designed by
the same authors.__

Autograd can automatically differentiate native Python and Numpy code. It can
handle a large subset of Python's features, including loops, ifs, recursion and
closures, and it can even take derivatives of derivatives of derivatives. It
supports reverse-mode differentiation (a.k.a. backpropagation), which means it
can efficiently take gradients of scalar-valued functions with respect to
array-valued arguments, as well as forward-mode differentiation, and the two can
be composed arbitrarily. The main intended application of Autograd is
gradient-based optimization. For more information, check out the
[tutorial](docs/tutorial.md) and the [examples directory](examples/).

Example use:

```python
>>> import autograd.numpy as np  # Thinly-wrapped numpy
>>> from autograd import grad    # The only autograd function you may ever need
>>>
>>> def tanh(x):                 # Define a function
...     y = np.exp(-2.0 * x)
...     return (1.0 - y) / (1.0 + y)
...
>>> grad_tanh = grad(tanh)       # Obtain its gradient function
>>> grad_tanh(1.0)               # Evaluate the gradient at x = 1.0
0.41997434161402603
>>> (tanh(1.0001) - tanh(0.9999)) / 0.0002  # Compare to finite differences
0.41997434264973155
```

We can continue to differentiate as many times as we like, and use numpy's
vectorization of scalar-valued functions across many different input values:

```python
>>> from autograd import elementwise_grad as egrad  # for functions that vectorize over inputs
>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
>>> x = np.linspace(-7, 7, 200)
>>> plt.plot(x, tanh(x),
...          x, egrad(tanh)(x),                                     # first  derivative
...          x, egrad(egrad(tanh))(x),                              # second derivative
...          x, egrad(egrad(egrad(tanh)))(x),                       # third  derivative
...          x, egrad(egrad(egrad(egrad(tanh))))(x),                # fourth derivative
...          x, egrad(egrad(egrad(egrad(egrad(tanh)))))(x),         # fifth  derivative
...          x, egrad(egrad(egrad(egrad(egrad(egrad(tanh))))))(x))  # sixth  derivative
>>> plt.show()
```

## How to install

Install Autograd using Pip:

```shell
pip install autograd
```

Some features require SciPy, which you can install separately or as an
optional dependency along with Autograd:

```shell
pip install "autograd[scipy]"
```
